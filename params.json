If you want the interval to occur between the end of one iteration and the beginning of the next, then use scheduleOnce.\r\n\r\n#### Create project using activator command\r\n\r\nIf you have Typesafe Activator, use its command line mode to create a new project from this template.\r\n\r\nType `activator new PROJECTNAME akka-scheduler` on the command line. \r\n\r\n#### Execute Scala Scheduler\r\n```\r\n$ ./activator \"project akka-scala\" run\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Execute Java Scheduler\r\n```\r\n$ ./activator \"project akka-java\" run\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
